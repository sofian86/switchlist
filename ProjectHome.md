SwitchList automatically generates lists of freight cars to switch on a model railroad, allowing your operators to perform realistic model railroad operations.  If you're a Mac user with a small model railroad or a shelf layout and want a switch list program thatâ€™s easy to set up and easy to use, try it out!

Download SwitchList from
[SwitchList's home page](http://www.vasonabranch.com/railroad/switchlist.html).
