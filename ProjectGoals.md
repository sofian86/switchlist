# Introduction #


There's many commercial and free switchlist generators out in the world; my goal with SwitchList is to make something special and different from what's available already.

If you're interested in contributing to SwitchList, keep these goals in mind as you consider features you'd like to add to SwitchList.

# Our Key Goals #

**Make it a great Macintosh application.**  SwitchList will be a great, native Macintosh application with an approachable and polished UI.  It should be easy to pick up and easy to use.

**Make it work well on small layouts.**  There's plenty of switchlist programs intended for huge, complex layouts, but what do modelers with more modest layouts need?  The primary use case is smaller layouts that want to do realistic operations.

**Make it realistic**.  While SwitchList's paperwork must be useful in the layout room, that can't mean it can't be realistic.  Forms should look like the prototype railroad's.

**Make it beautiful.**  SwitchList's paperwork shouldn't look like it was printed on a twenty-year-old IBM PC (unless the real switchlists were).  Forms should be handwritten.  Bonus points for adding greasy fingerprints automatically.

**Make use of information on the internet.**  If there's clever things we can do with sample lists of industries to automatically generate cargos, do that.
