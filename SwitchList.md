# Introduction #

SwitchList is a Macintosh program for automatically making lists of freight cars to switch on a model railroad. If you have a small model railroad or a shelf layout and want a switch list program that’s easy to set up and easy to use, try it out!

# Features #

  * Large print switch lists are easy to read and look handwritten. Make your operators think you spent all night writing up switch lists!
  * Graphical user interface for setting up and printing out switch lists. No more editing cryptic files being processed by a ten year old Tcl program!
  * Easy to adjust the available cargos for more realistic traffic flows. Adjusting operating sessions no longer means writing out a hundred new car cards!
  * Not all cars have to move each session, so movements appear more random. No more repetitive, identical operating sessions!
  * Allows realistic routing of different railroad’s empty freight cars to different staging yards. Empties leave in a realistic way.
  * Assigns freight cars based on owner of car. A C&O boxcar won’t be used to haul cement locally for your California railroad.
